# Hello There ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ryan. I like writing code.

I currently work at [Martin DSP](https://martin.ai) as a Senior DevOps Engineer where I collaborate with developers and business leaders to get application features to customers quickly while ensuring the reliability and observability of our internal developer and application platforms.

Daily, I work with the following tools in a production capacity at a massive scale:

* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)
* [Terraform](https://terraform.io)
* [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io)
* [Ansible - AWX](https://github.com/ansible/awx)
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
* [Spinnaker](https://spinnaker.io)
* [Go](https://go.dev)
* [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io)
* [ScyllaDB](https://scylladb.com)
* [Grafana](https://grafana.com)

I also have an interest in the following, but haven't deployed anything in a large capacity:

* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

Working with distributed systems has been central to my career, whether building supercomputers in a physical data center to working with Kubernetes in the cloud. I love building tools and processes to make these systems more reliable, scalable, and observable. 

Talks I've given:

* [Telepresence for Operations Teams - Devhouse 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQvJIP0zsqY)

# Hello There ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ryan. I like writing code.

I currently work at [dbt Labs](https://getdbt.com) as a Senior Product Security Engineer. I get to collaborate with engineering and business stateholders at the design and implemntation phase of feature development ensuring we shift left and think about security from the start. I help lead incident response best practices to lower mean time to response and resolution. I build tools to help secure our systems. My team replies to security-releasted questions, hardens IAM, and responds to Wiz or Expel alerts. There's always something new to do.

Daily, I work with the following tools in a production capacity at a massive scale:

* [Teleport](https://goteleport.com/)
* [Wiz](https://www.wiz.io/)
* [Expel](https://expel.com/services/managed-detection-response/)
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)
* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
* [Azure Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
* [Go](https://go.dev)
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Terraform](https://terraform.io)

I have spent nearly ten years building distributed systesm in the public clouds. During that time, I was always a security champion whether working in DevOps, SRE, or Development. Recently, I've had te opporutnity to do security full-time and I'm loving it.

Talks I've given:

* [Telepresence for Operations Teams - Devhouse 2021 (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQvJIP0zsqY)
* [Maximum Scylla Cluster Uptime with Ansible - Scylla Summit 2023 (Free On-Demand)](https://www.scylladb.com/presentations/maximum-uptime-cluster-orchestration-with-ansible/)
